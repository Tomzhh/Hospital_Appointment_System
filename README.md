# Hospital_Appointment_System
The main goal of this app is to provide a mobile application system for patients to interact with doctors and other staffs from nearby local hospitals in order to prevent time delays while billing and scheduling appointments. The application helps in overcoming the requirement of having files and pages for prescription and report.
